        I transformed my tech journey by shifting from a developer mindset to a
        software engineer&apos;s perspective. This change unlocked a world
        beyond just coding; I now tackle complex challenges across the entire
        software lifecycle—architecting solutions, optimizing scalability,
        ensuring robust security, and crafting resilient infrastructures.
        It&apos;s more than mastering frameworks; it&apos;s about engineering
        impactful, end-to-end solutions that elevate user experiences and drive
        innovation. This evolution has empowered me to think not just in terms
        of tools, but in terms of crafting solutions that shape the future.
